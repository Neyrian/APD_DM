--  INONDATION  --

    Each node that receives a message send this message 
    to all its neighbors. 
    this message is emitted by a (single) initiator (called InitNode)
    it is transmitted through the network 
       if the node already transmit to its neighbors, it will not
       handle the message  
    ... until it reaches its destination: the EndNode which stops it.
    
 Algorithm: (the message is called "the flood")

    1: if InitNode then
    2:     broadcast the flood to its neighbors

	3: forever
    4:     receive the flood from some node N
    4:     if EndNode then
    5:         do nothing! 
    6:     else
    7:    	   if hasn't broadcast it     
    8: 			  broadcast the flood to its neighbors
    9:	       else 
    10:			  do nothing!
